    "customer order processing Scenario: you are building a customer order processing system for an e-commence company. The system needs to interact with a MYSQL database to store customer order, products, and other details. Design a MYSQL database schema for the order processing system, including tables for customers, products and orders. Write a python program that connects to the database and allows customers to place new orders. Implement a feature that calculate that total cost of an order and updates product quantities in the database. How would you handle cases where a product is no longer available when a customer places an order ? .Develop a function to generate order for the company's finance department."
